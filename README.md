# Mazur's LookML Style Guide

Howdy! I'm [Matt Mazur](https://mattmazur.com/) and I'm a data analyst who has worked at several companies to help them use data to grow their businesses. I've been working in [Looker](http://looker.com/) almost daily since June 2017 and over time have developed various preferences for how to write clean, maintainable LookML. This guide is an attempt to document those preferences.

My goal with this guide is twofold: first, to share what I've learned so that it may help other LookML developers. Second, I'd love to get feedback from you all about how to improve how I write LookML. I'll incorporate any feedback from you all in here and give you credit where appropriate. You can find me on Twitter at [@mhmazur](https://twitter.com/mhmazur) (where I'll also be tweeting about updates to this guide) or by email at matthew.h.mazur@gmail.com.
